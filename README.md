# Neural-Machine-Translation

##Objective
-The objective of this project was to create a deep learning model capable of computing the derivative of a given function with respect to a specified variable. This challenge aims to showcase machine learning expertise, specifically avoiding heuristics or rule-based solutions. The project was initiated with a dataset provided in a Google Drive link, containing various examples of functions and their derivatives.
